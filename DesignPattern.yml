# We dont run two application in a single pod:
# 1) As it will become a single point of failure
# 2) sometimes we want to scale one but not other container in a pod

# Still we use MULTI-CONTAINER setup in the pod wrt to different usecase:
# 1) sidecar:
# when we have to run a n agent program along with the main application container, agent is in a separate container in a single pod
# as we inc the application container we also inc the agent container and this agent collects the logs from a centralized location shared
# by both the containers in a pod and send it to splunk or other tool

# 2) Adapter:
# Same as sidecar but before sending it to a third party, it Transforms the data and then send,operationcalled ETL is performed by 
# the agent i.e. Extract(extracting log directly from the container) transform( Transforming the logs to a specific format for the third party) 
# load( loading the transformed log to the third party app).

# 3) Adaptar:
# The second container is a proxy container for to connect the main application container with the other database/other programs/pods , 
# the proxy container acts as an intermediate between the main application container and the other pods.
